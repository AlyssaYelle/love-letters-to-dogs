# love-letters-to-dogs

A cute little browser app inspired by the [Dog CEO API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/about).

## How to use

- Navigate to [alyssayelle.github.io/love-letters-to-dogs/](https://alyssayelle.github.io/love-letters-to-dogs/).
- A random dog image will be displayed. Selecting 'yes' will take you to a form where you can write a love letter. Selecting 'no' will generate a new dog.
- Write your love letter! Upon submission you'll be redirected to a page where you can view all of your love letters. If you want to write more, use the menu to go home. You can use the menu to view all of your love letters, which will persist until you clear your browser storage or it expires.
